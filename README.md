# Secure Nonce Management System Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of a secure nonce management system intended for use in distributed systems, ensuring uniqueness, security, and efficient management of nonces. The system includes mechanisms for generating secure nonces, validating their uniqueness, and pruning expired or used nonces to maintain system efficiency.

## System Components

### Nonce Structure

```go
type Nonce struct {
    Address   string
    Value     uint32
    Hash      []byte
    Timestamp int64
}
```

- **Address**: A unique identifier (e.g., a network address) associated with the nonce.
- **Value**: A securely generated random value serving as the nonce.
- **Hash**: A cryptographic hash of the nonce value, ensuring integrity.
- **Timestamp**: The creation time of the nonce, used for expiry checks.

### Secure Nonce Generation

Nonces are generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) provided by the `crypto/rand` package in Go. This ensures that nonces are unpredictable and resistant to guessing or brute-force attacks.

```go
func generateSecureNonce() (uint32, error) {
    var nonce uint32
    err := binary.Read(rand.Reader, binary.BigEndian, &nonce)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, err
    }
    return nonce, nil
}
```

### Nonce Storage

Nonces are stored in a thread-safe map, keyed by the associated address, ensuring that there is only one nonce per address.

```go
var (
    nonces      = make(map[string]NonceMapEntry)
    noncesMutex sync.RWMutex
)
```

### Nonce Validation

Nonces are validated by checking their existence in the nonce map and ensuring they have not expired based on their timestamp.

```go
func ValidateNonce(address string, nonce Nonce) bool {
    noncesMutex.RLock()
    defer noncesMutex.RUnlock()

    entry, exists := nonces[address]
    return exists && nonce.Value == entry.Value && bytes.Equal(nonce.Hash, entry.Hash) && time.Now().Unix()-entry.Timestamp <= nonceLifetime
}
```

### Nonce Pruning

To maintain system efficiency, a mechanism for pruning expired nonces based on a predefined lifetime is implemented. This process runs periodically and removes nonces that have surpassed their expiry time.

```go
func pruneExpiredNonces() {
    noncesMutex.Lock()
    defer noncesMutex.Unlock()

    currentTimestamp := time.Now().Unix()
    for address, entry := range nonces {
        if currentTimestamp-entry.Timestamp > nonceLifetime {
            delete(nonces, address)
        }
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Entropy and Randomness**: Ensuring the CSPRNG provides high entropy to prevent nonce predictability.
- **Nonce Length**: Using a sufficient nonce length to avoid collisions and enhance security.
- **Expiry and Pruning**: Implementing expiry times and regular pruning to mitigate replay attacks and manage storage efficiently.
- **Thread-Safety**: Employing mutexes to ensure thread-safe operations on the nonce storage map.

## Implementation Notes

- **Concurrency**: The system is designed to be thread-safe, allowing concurrent nonce generation, validation, and pruning.
- **Scalability**: By pruning expired nonces and optimizing storage, the system remains efficient as usage scales.
- **Extensibility**: The design allows for future enhancements, such as integrating more complex validation schemes or updating cryptographic primitives.

## Future Work

- **Rate Limiting**: Implementing rate limiting for nonce generation and validation to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Establishing mechanisms for auditing nonce usage and monitoring for abnormal patterns that may indicate security issues.

This document serves as a reference for the current design and implementation of the secure nonce management system, providing a foundation for future development and enhancements.

- **LocationKey**: `kyber.Point` - Cryptographic commitment to the AnonGeoLocation.
- **PrivateKey**: `kyber.Scalar` - Node's private key for cryptographic operations.
- **PublicKey**: `kyber.Point` - Node's public key derived from the private key.

### **Functionalities**

#### **NewNetworkAddress(lat, long float64)**

- Initializes a `NetworkAddress` with anonymized geographic data and cryptographic keys.

#### **PublicKeyBase64() string**

- Returns the public key in Base64 encoded format.
